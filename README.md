# TradeVision

This is a pure Rust library which gets real time[^1] data from TradingView. Currently only supporting Rust, it can support JS/TS with Tauri and other equivalents.

[^1]: It can only retrieve the data from TradingView at default speeds, some markets may be time delayed.

This aims to be a rust equivalent of [TradingView-API](https://github.com/Mathieu2301/TradingView-API).

## Features
